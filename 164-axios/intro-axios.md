# Intro to Axios
    - Axios can be downloaded as a node_module, or attained through a CDN
    - A CDN, or Content Deliver Network, is loaded into your application through a script tag on your html page.
        - The axios CDN can be found on cdnjs.com's website: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/axios
        
    - Axios is a promise based HTTP client.
    - This means it allows us to make HTTP requests, and the handling of those requests and the subsequent responses on the front end is handled with promises.
    
    here is the script tag that goes before the script tag for our js file
