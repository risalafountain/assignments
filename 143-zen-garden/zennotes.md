### **HINTS and Help**

- Links and JavaScript functionality do not have to work.
- Fonts, images, etc can be found in the sources tab.
- Write your HTML and CSS from scratch. Do not copy and paste from Chrome dev tools.
- This project is expected to take a lot of time. It's difficult. Please don't get stuck on any one aspect for too long. Ask your class mates how they approached different problems.
- USE YOUR DEV TOOLS. Switching from chrome to your editor will WASTE TIME.
- The social media icons at the bottom of the page are actually a font, not images. Check the sources tab to find the font and feel free to download it from there



This is for responsive design. If you watch how the layout changes when your screen size shrinks down, you'll see how they pieces are detached.

A mix of CSS Grid and media queries is the best grid system for this site in my opinion. It's going to be better for setting up the layout of the whole site than flexbox, Bootstrap's grid system, and for sure better than the old CSS positioning, or using HTML Tables. Flexbox is good for the social icons in this assignment. Feel free to use it inside any of the panels.
