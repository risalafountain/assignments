JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is an extension syntax in React that allows you to write HTML-like code directly in your JavaScript files. It's a way to describe the structure and appearance of your components in a familiar and concise manner.

Here are two short examples of JSX:

Example 1: Creating a React component with JSX

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = () => {
return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};
```

In this example, we define a functional component called **`Greeting`** using JSX syntax. The component renders an **`<h1>`** element with the text "Hello, World!".

Example 2: Embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Profile = () => {

const name = 'John Doe';
const age = 25;

return (
	<div>
		<h2>{name}</h2>
		<p>Age: {age}</p>
	</div>
);
};
```

In this example, we define a component called **`Profile`** using JSX. We embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces **`{}`** to dynamically render the **`name`** and **`age`** variables in the JSX code. The resulting HTML will display the name and age values.

In both examples, JSX simplifies the process of defining and rendering components by providing a concise and intuitive syntax that closely resembles HTML. It allows you to combine JavaScript logic and HTML-like structure within a single file, making it easier to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React.
