# Important Note: Algorithm Parameter Requirement

### **Error('algorithms should be set'):**

- **Issue**: As of the latest updates to express-jwt, it's now mandatory to include an 'algorithms' parameter, in addition to the 'secret' key, for proper configuration.
- **Documentation Reference**: The [express-jwt documentation](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt#required-parameters) outlines the necessity of specifying the algorithm parameter for secure JWT token verification.

**Example of Algorithm Parameter Usage:**

When configuring `expressJwt`, ensure that the 'algorithms' parameter is set as follows:

```jsx
app.use('/api', expressJwt({ secret: process.env.SECRET, algorithms: ['HS256'] }));

```

This ensures secure JWT token verification using the HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) algorithm.

Please update your configuration to adhere to these requirements to avoid issues with JWT token validation.

### **Note on Requiring expressjwt** (Updated on 8/3/22):

- **Syntax Update**: To require `expressjwt` following the latest express-jwt documentation as of August 3, 2022, it's recommended to use the following syntax:
    
    ```jsx
    var { expressjwt: jwt } = require("express-jwt");
    
    ```
    

[update applies to express-jwt v6.0.0 or higher](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt#required-parameters)

# Code Explanation: JWT Authentication and Error Handling

This code snippet focuses on implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for certain routes and error handling in a Node.js application, possibly using the Express.js framework. It consists of two main components: JWT authentication middleware and error handling middleware.

## JWT Authentication Middleware

```jsx
app.use('/main', expressjwt({ secret: process.env.SECRET, algorithms: ['HS256'] }))

```

- **Purpose**: This middleware is responsible for validating incoming JWT tokens.
- **Route Restriction**: It is applied to routes that start with '/main'.
- **JWT Verification**: It uses the `expressjwt` middleware for JWT verification.
- **Secret Key**: The verification process relies on a secret key, which is retrieved from the environment variable `process.env.SECRET`.
- **Allowed Algorithm**: The `algorithms` option specifies the allowed algorithms for JWT verification, with 'HS256' indicating the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.

## Error Handling Middleware

```jsx
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
   console.log(err);
   if (err.name === "UnauthorizedError") {
       res.status(err.status);
   }
   return res.send({ errMsg: err.message });
})

```

- **Purpose**: This middleware deals with errors that may occur during JWT verification or authentication.
- **Parameters**: It accepts four parameters: `err` (the error object), `req` (the request object), `res` (the response object), and `next` (the next middleware function).
- **Error Logging**: If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console for debugging purposes.

## Handling "UnauthorizedError"

```jsx
if (err.name === "UnauthorizedError") {
   res.status(err.status);
}

```

- **Purpose**: This section checks whether the error's `name` property matches "UnauthorizedError," which is a common indicator of errors related to failed authentication or JWT verification.
- **HTTP Status Code**: If it is indeed an "UnauthorizedError," the HTTP response status is set to the status code of the error. Typically, this would be an HTTP 401 status code, indicating unauthorized access.

## Sending Error Response to the Client

```jsx
return res.send({ errMsg: err.message });

```

- **Purpose**: Regardless of the error type, this code sends a response to the client containing an error message in the format `{ errMsg: err.message }`. The `err.message` provides details about the specific error that occurred.
