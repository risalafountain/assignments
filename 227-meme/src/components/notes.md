so far we have only done static websites
Read-only: no changes in data 
EX: blogs, news sites, recipes,


dynamic websites
Read-Write: ability to change data 
highly interactive 
displays your data 
EX: bank website, AirBnb, social media

Meme Generator: 
reach out to api and get 100 meme images 
choose text on top and bottom 

What we'll learn 
--event listeners 
--state
--conditional rendering 
--forms
--side effects 

Break the app down into smaller pieces 
Start w/ header since it is static and we already know how to do that. 

PROJECT ANALYSIS--228.75
1. when the app loads, it is immediately going to makea call to API "image flip"
2. tapping get new meme image will randomly generate one
    -create event listener and run "some kind of logic" once the button is clicked 
3. typing in each input box will apply it to the top and bottom of image

GET RANDOM MEME--229.75
    /**
     * Challenge: Get a random image from the `memesData` array
     * when the "new meme image" button is clicked.
     * 
     * Log the URL of the image to the console. (Don't worry
     * about displaying the image yet)
