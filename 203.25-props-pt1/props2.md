- Props (short for properties) in React are used to pass data and configuration from a parent component to its child components.
- They allow for dynamic customization of components based on specific requirements.
- Props enable the sharing of data between components in a unidirectional manner.
- They establish a clear and predictable data flow pattern in React applications.
- Props facilitate communication and synchronization between different parts of an application.
- Similar to how input properties like placeholder and type configure an input element, props configure React components.
- Props promote reusability and modularity by abstracting functionality and data into customizable parameters.

in HTML page 
anchor tag intended for linking to some thing else but needs an href attribute

img tag needs a src attribute

input tag needs placeholder or type attribute

in JS 
a function like this 

function addTwoNumbersTogether() {
    return 1 + 2
}

this will always add the numbers 1 and 2 and return 3 

adding parameters will allow us to let us add whatever 2 numbers we want

function addTwoNumbersTogether(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
