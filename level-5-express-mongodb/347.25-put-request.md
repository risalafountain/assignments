# Edit Functionality in Express: Updating Movie Data

## Implementing the Edit Route

To enable users to edit movie details, we'll create a `PUT` route. This route will take a movie's unique ID as a parameter and update the movie object with the provided data. Here's the code for the `PUT` route:

```jsx
app.put('/movies/:movieId', (req, res) => {
    const movieId = req.params.movieId; // Get the movie ID from the request parameters.
    const updatedObject = req.body; // Get the updated movie data from the request body.

    // Find the index of the movie to be updated in the 'movies' array.
    const movieIndex = movies.findIndex(movie => movie._id === movieId);

    if (movieIndex !== -1) {
        // If the movie is found, update its data.
        const updatedMovie = Object.assign(movies[movieIndex], updatedObject);
        res.send(updatedMovie);
    } else {
        // If the movie is not found, send an error response.
        res.status(404).send('Movie not found');
    }
});

```

## Understanding the Edit Route

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. We define a `PUT` route with the path `/movies/:movieId`. The `:movieId` part in the path is a URL parameter, which allows us to specify the ID of the movie to be updated.
2. Inside the route handler, we retrieve the movie ID from the request parameters (`req.params.movieId`) and the updated movie data from the request body (`req.body`).
3. We use the `Array.findIndex` method to find the index of the movie with the matching ID in the `movies` array.
4. If the movie is found (i.e., `movieIndex` is not -1), we update the movie object by merging it with the updated data using `Object.assign`.
5. We send the updated movie object as the response.
6. If the movie is not found (i.e., `movieIndex` is -1), we send a 404 status code along with an error message to indicate that the movie was not found.
