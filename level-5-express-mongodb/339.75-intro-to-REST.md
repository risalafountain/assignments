# Intro to REST API Architecture 

# REST-REpresentational State Transfer

# Resource- represents a single item (object) in a database     /user 

# Collection- a collection of similar items in a database    /users

# Base (root) URL-homepage name and a forward slash URL-http://amazon.com/

# API Endpoint- http://amazon.com/movies/
    --to extend to a single movie, use ids
    --without id get collection

# Parameters - placeholder for data movies/:movieID

# Query (query string) - begins with a ? and key value pairs /movies?genre=action&year=1999

go into movies database and return action movies released in 1999

# Client - front end 
website/app the user is interacting

# Server - intermediary 

# Request Method - CRUD - GET POST PUT DELETE 

# Example
Build a website for a camping goods store that sells tents sleeping bags, cooking stuff, attire, etc. 

Make readable endpoints that represent state  
    
    </tents> is good but allow it to be more accessible by having a more general endpoint
    
     </equipment/tents > 
     
     or to look at one specific tent use ids 
    
    </equipment/tents/fje8996553ofhj>
    
    sleeping bags </equipment/sleepingbags>
