NOTE:
You will only have to do this to make React work within Scrimba.

The FOCUS is not how to CREATE a react app at this point, the FOCUS is how WRITE react.

get rid of cdns and babel from html
add 
dependencies react@17.0.2
react-dom@17.0.2

if you are not using scrimba still use cdns
