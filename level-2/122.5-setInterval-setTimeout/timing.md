# JS Timing Functions
    
    # setInterval
        Purpose: Call a function on a repeated basis. (ex: every 1 second)
        
    # setTimeout
        Purpose: Call a function after a certain amount of time.
        
    
    * When used, both setInterval and setTimeout return and ID.  That ID can be given to clearInterval or clearTimeout to stop the timers.
