 * QUIZ:
 * 
 * 1. Why do programmers care about loops? What are they good for?
 * Allow programmer to run the same code many times
 * 
 * 2. In a for loop, what are the 3 main parts that go into the parentheses?
 * for (1. initialize variables, 2. condition (should it run one more time?. 3 final code taht we want to run at the end of the loop) { this is the acutal code that we will be running at the end of the loop }
 * 
 * 3. Write a loop that logs the numbers 15 to 50 (inclusive) to the console.
 * for (var i = 15 (instead of starting at 0);i <= 50 (less than or equal to); i ++ (means to increase i by one)) {
 *  console.log(i)}
 * 
 * 4. Write a loop that logs the numbers 0 to 10 (inclusive) to the console, but if the number is 7, also log "It's your lucky day!"
 for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i ++) {
    console.log[i]
    if (i === 7) {
        console.log ("It's your lucky day!")
    }
 }
