when new data comes in, how do we have it show up to the user automatically? 
there are frameworks in place like Angular or React but if we are not using either of those frameworks, then we must engineer it ourselves by doing the following:

# Get the TODOs from the database 
# List the TODO titles to the DOM 
# Apply even listeners to the form for the POST request
