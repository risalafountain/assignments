    Responsive Design
    - Designing a webpage so that a user may access your site on any sized device, mainly mobile, tablet and desktop, and your website will respond appropriately.
    
    - Common method for approach is Mobile First, meaning to do your mobile design first and then use media queries to style the tablet and desktop views.
    
    Always start w/ Mobile First: uses the least amount of CSS then gradually get bigger
    
    --CSS MEDIA QUERIES 
    base syntax @media () {} (just like JS FUNCTIONS)
    use the word only: lets older browsers ignore like only screen and (insert width here)
    
    CSS is past forward 
    --the only time anything changes is if we manually edit it in the query
