1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
   
   a. pass in the new value of state 
   b. pass a callback function - whatever the callback function returns will be the new value of state


2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

    anytime you want to update your state and DO NOT  need the previous value of state to help you determine the new value of state
