        <div id="box1">Box 1</div>

<!--
    The order of the Box Model from inside out
    
    1. Content (the element's context such as text)
    2. Padding:
         (the spacing between the content and the element's border) when putting the sizes inline it will go counter clockwise
    3. Border (the element's border)
    4. Margin (the spacing between the elements border and other neighboring elements)
    
    * in CSS is used to default all margin and padding 
    
    --by default, without text in the box, it won't have dimension so if there's no content than you need to be able to have a border to see the box
