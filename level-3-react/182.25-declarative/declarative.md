Declarative: What should be done? 
"Tell me what to do and I'll worry about how to get it done" 

Imperative: How should it be done? 
"describe to me every step on how to do something, and i'll do it" 
JS is imperative. 

React is considered declarative because it focuses on describing what the user interface should look like, rather than explicitly defining how to achieve that result.

In traditional imperative programming, you have to write step-by-step instructions for the computer to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and update the user interface. This approach often leads to complex and error-prone code, especially when dealing with dynamic or interactive interfaces.

React takes a different approach. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you describe the desired UI state, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM to match that state. You define the components and their properties, and React handles rendering and re-rendering efficiently.

By adopting a declarative approach, React provides several benefits:

1. Simplicity: Writing declarative code is often simpler and easier to understand. You focus on describing the final UI state and React figures out how to update the DOM accordingly. This abstraction hides the low-level details, making the code more concise and readable.
2. Readability: Declarative code reads more like a description of the UI structure and behavior. It's easier for developers (including yourself and others) to understand and maintain the codebase, as they can quickly grasp the intention and logic behind it.
3. Predictability: With React's declarative nature, the UI rendering becomes predictable. Given a specific set of inputs or props, React ensures that the resulting UI will always be consistent and deterministic. This predictability makes debugging and testing easier.
4. Efficient Updates: React optimizes the process of updating the DOM by using a virtual DOM. It intelligently compares the previous and current UI states and only updates the necessary parts, minimizing the number of actual DOM manipulations. This efficient diffing algorithm is a result of React's declarative approach.
5. Component Reusability: Declarative code naturally promotes component reusability. Since components are self-contained and describe their desired UI state, they can be easily reused in different parts of the application or even in other projects.

In summary, React's declarative nature simplifies UI development by allowing you to describe the desired UI state, while React handles the underlying logic of rendering and updating. This approach enhances code simplicity, readability, predictability, efficiency, and component reusability.
