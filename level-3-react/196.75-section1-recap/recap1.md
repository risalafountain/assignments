**React Components Recap**

1. **Composable and Declarative:**
    - React is composable, meaning that components can be combined and nested to create complex UI structures.
    - Composability allows for reusable and modular code, making development more efficient.
    - React is also declarative, where developers define what the UI should look like based on the current state, and React takes care of updating the actual DOM.
2. **JSX Syntax:**
    - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files in React.
    - JSX makes it easier to define the structure and content of React components.
    - It allows you to seamlessly mix JavaScript expressions and HTML-like syntax.
3. **Custom Components:**
    - React supports creating custom components to encapsulate specific functionality or UI elements.
    - Custom components promote reusability, code organization, and separation of concerns.
    - They can be composed and combined to build complex user interfaces.
4. **Styling in React:**
    - React provides multiple approaches for styling components, including inline styles, CSS classes, external stylesheets, and CSS modules.
    - Inline styles allow for dynamic styling based on component state or props, using the **`style`** prop.
    - CSS classes and the **`className`** attribute can be used to apply styles from external stylesheets or define styles within the component itself.
    - External stylesheets and CSS modules offer more traditional approaches for styling, providing a separation between styles and component logic.

By understanding the concepts of composability and declarative nature, utilizing JSX syntax, creating custom components, and exploring different styling approaches, developers can effectively leverage React's features to build dynamic, modular, and visually appealing web applications.
