In simple terms, React is "composable" because it allows you to put together smaller, reusable building blocks to create bigger and more complex things.

Think of it like building with Lego blocks. You have different Lego pieces that you can connect and stack to create various structures. Similarly, in React, you have small building blocks called components that you can combine to build your user interface.

Each component has a specific job or functionality, like a button or a form input. You can use these components in different parts of your application and even combine them to create more advanced components.

The cool thing is that each component is independent and can be developed separately. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and test your code. If you need to change something in one component, it won't affect the others.

This composable nature of React allows you to build your app like a puzzle, fitting the pieces together. It makes your code more organized and scalable. As your app grows, you can add new components or modify existing ones without causing chaos in the whole system.

So, in a nutshell, React's composability means you can mix and match small, reusable components to build complex and interactive user interfaces. It's like building with Lego, but with code!
