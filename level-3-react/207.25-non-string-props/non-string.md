Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that wasn't a string datatype??

For example, if you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" and "downvotes" prop that is a number, as well as a prop with an array of comments, and a boolean of whether the joke is a pun (true or false).

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Joke
        punchline="Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
        isPun={true}
        upvotes={10}
        downvotes={2}
        comments={[{ author: "", body: "", title: "" }]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
